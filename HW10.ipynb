    "The model only explains 17.6% of the variability:\n",
    "This is like saying, \"Knowing someone's favorite color and food doesn't explain much about their overall personality.\" There are many other factors‚Äîlike hobbies, life experiences, or relationships‚Äîthat are missing from the picture.\n",

    "Some coefficients are large and statistically significant:\n",

    "Learning from Experience (Generations 1 vs. 1‚Äì5):\n",
    "A person who only learns from a narrow set of experiences (like Pok√©mon from Generation 1) might struggle to apply their knowledge to new situations (like Generation 6). On the other hand, someone exposed to a wider variety of experiences (Generations 1‚Äì5) is more likely to understand patterns that apply to different contexts.\n",

    "In essence, this is a mathematical take on how learning happens: starting specific, testing knowledge broadly, and refining approaches to adapt better over time‚Äîmuch like human learning and reasoning!"
